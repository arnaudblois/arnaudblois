# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for visiting my profile.

I am Arnaud Blois, a web developer and Python expert in London. I am always keen to support the Python community, I maintain several open-source projects to help fellow developers, especially in the CI/CD space (secure Docker images for Python, automated templating engine, etc).

I really enjoy getting to know fellow professionals, don't hesitate to connect with me :) <br/><br/>
